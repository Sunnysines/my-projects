#UPDATE : 30 JUNE 2023
Alright i am back after 2 or 3 years.... and now i feel have i have lost my track.... i belive that i can be better than what i was before even if restrat my
journey by brushing up my basic skills on programming.... i already have little experience with python...even though i was weak at fille handaling protion....
within these two years i strave away all my distrctions in order to focus on my High School compititive exam ..... i would like to use the experience that i got while i was preparing for this examinatin.Also i will continue this journey with python randomly and slowly as i will have to start programming with c and c++ as per the collage syllabus and i would love  to build the fundamentals of 'OOPs' using C and C++....i am excieted and dedicated to start a new journey of programming using a new language which is used for years.... i will use the same cruks and algoritims to master c and c++ which i did for python.
